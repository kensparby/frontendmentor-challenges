## My process

### Built with

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool. If you're still using Create-React-App; use this instead.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - A superset of CSS

### What I learned

I learned to just do grids with CSS grid next time. Flex-wrap is "okay", but ehh. If you need a grid, well, use a grid.
